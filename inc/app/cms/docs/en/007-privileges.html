<h1>Authentication and Privileges</h1>

Sitellite's user authentication and privilege system is based on a number of concepts and their relations to one another.  These include:<br /><ul><li>User</li><li>Role</li><li>Team</li><li>Resource</li><li>Status</li><li>Access Level</li></ul>A user simply means someone who is registered in the system.  A user can be an administrative-level user (ie. a writer, an editor, the master administrator, etc.), or not (ie. a member, a subscriber, a customer, etc.).  Users are stored by default in the "sitellite_user" database table, but drivers can be used to plug in users from LDAP or other sources.  All of the other permissions are stored in the inc/conf/auth folder in INI files.<br /><br />A role is a description of the activities a user is supposed to perform in the system, ie. their privileges.  A role basically describes which resources, statuses, and access levels a user can read from and write to.  Users belong to a single role.<br /><br />A team is a logical grouping together of users that perform a series of roles on a specific area or aspect of the site.  When documents are created in the system, they are not owned by individual users, but by teams.  Users belong to only one team, but can be assigned access to additional teams, on a read or write basis.  This allows for the possibility of restricting users to specific areas of the site based on team ownership, but also for the possibility of cross-collaboration.<br /><br />A resource is an abstract term for "any piece of the system that should be restricted as a whole".  A resource usually means a content collection (ie. data type) or an app (ie. add-on), but can mean anything you need it to.  Resources can be added and then used programmatically in custom applications to provide unlimited flexibility of access control.<br /><br />A status is the state a document is in at any given time.  The default statuses are "draft", "queued", "approved", "archived", and "rejected".  An example of restricting users based on status would be the writer role, who doesn't have permission to publish approved documents on his own, but requires an editor's approval.<br /><br />An access level is a setting used both in the Sitellite user interface and in the front-end of your web site to restrict access to different user roles.  The default access levels are "public", "member", "subscriber", and "private".  Using these, you can assign documents to be visible only to registered web site members, or only to administrators, and thereby achieve a multi-tiered web site that can serve simultaneously as public-facing web site, member-only support site or customer extranet, and private employee intranet.<br /><br />Statuses and access levels pertain to specific documents, not to resources as a whole.<br /><h2>Session Drivers</h2>Additionally, Sitellite's authentication layer includes a threefold abstraction of parts: the Session Source, the Session Handler, and the Session Store.  Together these provide the maximum level of flexibility of possible configurations, although in truth usually the default setup is more than adequate.<br /><br />Source drivers allow you to plug in alternative sources for authentication users against, such as an LDAP directory.  The default source is the "sitellite_user" MySQL database table.<br /><br />Handler drivers allow you to plug in additional methods of authentication for alternate user clients, such as HTTP Basic or Digest, or other client-server authentication models for custom applications.  The default handler uses a session ID over a browser cookie, which is more secure than HTTP Basic, especially where a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) is not being used.<br /><br />Store drivers allow you to control where session data is stored.  The default is using PHP's built-in session storage capabilities, but if those are inappropriate for your custom use then Sitellite allows you to easily switch to another custom solution.<br /><br />

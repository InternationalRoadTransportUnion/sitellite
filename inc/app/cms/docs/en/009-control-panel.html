<h1>User Interface: Control Panel</h1>

The Control Panel can be seen as Sitellite's advanced mode, but it also provides access to other components of the system that are not visible through the Web View.  These may include additional content collections, user/permission management, additional add-ons, and the Sitellite internal messaging inbox.<br />

<br />

The following screenshot highlights the elements of Sitellite's Control Panel.<br />

<br />

The Content Collections panel provides easy access to all of the content collections managed by your Sitellite CMS installation.� The default collections are Web Pages, Web Files, News Stories, and Sidebars.� From here you can browse the documents in each collection, add new documents to a collection, and view the deleted documents from a collection, which allows you to restore them if necessary.� Consider this an unlimited undo feature.<br />

<br />

The Admin Utilities are where web site administrators can manage users, roles, teams, and permissions.� Users that don't have access to those capabilities will see a greyed-out panel to show that it is inactive and can't be accessed by them.<br />

<br />

The Additional Add-Ons is a list of other applications that have been written on top of the Sitellite CMS platform.<br />

<br />

The Sitellite Inbox shows you any new messages sent to you from within Sitellite's internal messaging system.� Sitellite's messaging system is a powerful way to send, receive, and archive messages, and can integrate seamlessly with email, Jabber instant messaging, and soon with SMS text messaging as well.<br />

<br />

The Internal Bookmarks are a list of links to commonly visited locations within the Sitellite Control Panel, which allows you to save complex searches and activities to be able to come back to them in a single click.<br />

<br />

The Traffic Overview is added in the Professional Edition, or when you have the SiteTracker add-on installed.� It presents a short summary of your web site's daily visitor activity, and leads into the full SiteTracker add-on.<br />

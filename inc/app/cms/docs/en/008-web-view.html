<h1>User Interface: Web View</h1>

The Web View is the primary user interface of Sitellite, which is to present your web site to you, with the addition of the Sitellite toolbar and inline buttons that allow you to manipulate the various elements of a given web page, including content and sidebars.� The following screenshot highlights the elements of Sitellite's Web View.<br />

<br />



The Toolbar is used to switch between the Web View and Sitellite's other mode, the Control Panel, as well as to change your preferences, reference the built-in Sitellite help, and log out.� It is also an indicator to users that they are logged in.<br />



<br />



The Add, Edit, and Delete buttons perform their respective functions on the block of content that corresponds to them (ie. usually the one closest to them).� The Add button will add a new element, either to that area of the screen, or as a new item in the case of collections such as Web Pages and News Stories.<br />



<br />



The Change History button allows you to see a list of all of the changes that have been made to the corresponding content item.� From the change history, you are able to compare previous versions to the current version of an item, and even revert to a previous version of that item.<br />



<br />



The Up / Down buttons allow you to change the ordering of the items in a sidebar column on the page.� This allows you to move, for example, a banner ad above or below another navigation box in a single click.<br />

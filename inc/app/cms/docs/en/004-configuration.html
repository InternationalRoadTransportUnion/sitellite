<h1>Configuration Options</h1>

Sitellite's primary configuration file format is called INI.  INI files are formatted into key/value pairs, and are very fast and convenient for Sitellite developers to make use of.  Sometimes Sitellite-based apps and add-ons also use configuration options embedded in PHP files.  In these cases, the file is always the conf/properties.php file inside the app's folder.<br /><br />Below is an overview of the configuration options in Sitellite's global configuration file, located at inc/conf/config.ini.php in any Sitellite installation.  The global configuration is broken up into several sections, including:<br /><ul><li>Database</li><li>Site</li><li>Server</li><li>Cache</li><li>I18n</li><li>Messaging</li></ul><h2>Database Options</h2>The database options are as follows:<br /><ul><li><strong>connection_name</strong> - The name of the current database connection, used by the global $dbm object for managing multiple connections.  See saf.Database.Manager at <a href="http://www.sitellite.org/docs">http://www.sitellite.org/docs</a> for more info.</li><li><strong>driver</strong> - The driver corresponds to which database software you are using.  Currently, only MySQL is officially supported.  For a list of drivers, see the folder saf/lib/Database/Driver.</li><li><strong>hostname</strong> - This is the name of the database server.  If it is the same as the web server, often "localhost" is fine.</li><li><strong>database</strong> - This is the name of your database on the database server.</li><li><strong>username</strong> - The username you must supply to the database server in order to connect and send queries.</li><li><strong>password</strong> - The password you must supply to the database server in order to connect and send queries.</li><li><strong>persistent</strong> - Specifies whether or not to use persistent connections when connecting to your database.  May be specified as 1 or 0, true/false, yes/no, or on/off.</li></ul><h2>Site Options</h2>The site options pertain to the web site's location on your web server.<br /><ul><li><strong>docroot</strong> - The full directory path to the web site document root directory.</li><li><strong>usedocroot</strong> - Determines whether to use the document root</li><li><strong>prefix</strong> - Sets the path in the URL to Sitellite.</li><li><strong>secure</strong> - If your site sits behind an Secure Socket Layer (SS), then change this to 1.</li><li><strong>safpath</strong> - Sets the path to the Sitellite Application Framework (SAF) from the document root.</li></ul><h2>Server Options</h2>The server options pertain to the Sitellite Content Server behaviour.<br /><ul><li><strong>default_handler</strong> - This is the name of the default request handler, when no specific request is made (ie. a request for yourWebSite.com/ or /index).</li><li><strong>default_handler_type</strong> - This is the name of the default handler type.  The type may be one of 'document', 'box', or 'form'.</li><li><strong>default_template_set</strong> - This is the default template set (ie. theme) used to render pages.  By using this setting, you can add your own template themes, install multiple themes in the same Sitellite installation, by adding instead of changing what's already there.</li><li><strong>default_template</strong> - This is the default template used to render pages.  The default value is "default", which says to use html.default.tpl as your default.  If your template sets are properly named, you likely do not need to modify this setting.</li><li><strong>error_handler</strong> - This is the name of the error handler, when an invalid request is made.</li><li><strong>error_handler_type</strong> - This is the name of the error handler type, when an invalid request is made.  The type may be one of 'document', 'box', or 'form'.</li><li><strong>send_version_header</strong> - This determines whether Sitellite will send an X-Powered-By HTTP header with the response.  The default is 'on', which shouldn't be a problem, but some may prefer to turn it off as one extra security-through-obscurity measure.</li><li><strong>default_app</strong> - This sets the default app to look in for boxes, forms, settings, etc. The default 'webapp' is where you can place your custom code for a single web site.  However, if you are looking to create reusable apps, it is best to create a new app directory structure and not use the default in that case.</li><li><strong>debug</strong> - Setting this to 'off' removes comments added by the html_marker(), which is used by XT to display the positioning of boxes and forms within a rendered page.  html_marker() can also be used inside your custom application code to produce markers to help you find problems more easily when viewing the outputted source in web browsers.</li><li>error_reporting - Set this to the error reporting level that you wish to run your site at.  You may wish to increase this during development and/or decrease it on live web sites.  For more info, see: <a href="http://www.php.net/error_reporting">http://www.php.net/error_reporting</a></li></ul><h2>Cache Options</h2>The cache options determine whether and how the output caching is used.<br /><ul><li><strong>duration</strong> - This sets the page-level cache duration.  The value is specified in seconds, and 0 means no page-level caching.  Note: Page-level caching should only be used on pages that can't ever contain user-specific data.  If this rule is not kept, then data specific to one user could end up in the hands of another.  This means that page-level caching is not always the right choice in all circumstances.<br /></li><li><strong>location</strong> - This is the location to store the page-level cache.  It may be a directory name (ie. cache/pages), mod:proxy, which will not actually cache the pages but instead set the proper HTTP headers for a proxy/cache server or the visitors' browsers to cache the page for us, or bdb:path/to/page_store.db, which specifies the path to a Berkeley DB file which can contain the pages as key/value pairs in a single file and use a BDB daemon to retrieve them.  BDB may prove faster than the filesystem at performing lookups because it can keep the data in memory between requests.  BDB stores require PHP to be configured with the DBA extension and linked against a Berkeley DB3 installation (ie. --with-db3).  For more information, see php.net/dba.<br /></li><li><strong>proxystore</strong> - This is the location to store proxy cache "tag" files, which are empty files that are created and updated on creation and re-creation of a mod:proxy cached page.  The modification times of these files are used to determine whether or not to regenerate the file or simply send the appropriate "still good" HTTP headers instead.  Specified as a directory (ie. cache/proxy).<br /></li><li><strong>cacheable</strong> - This is a comma-separated list (no spaces) of paths that qualify for page-level caching.  An asterisk is a wildcard character that basically says "anything goes." Examples: /index,/index/news,/index/news/*<br /></li><li><strong>querycaching</strong> - This sets the per-query cache duration.  The value is specified in seconds, and 0 means no per-query caching.  Per-query caching caches individual database queries, and must be specified on a per-query basis (see saf.Database.Query in DocReader or saf/docs for more info).<br /></li><li><strong>qcachelocation</strong> - This is the location to store the per-query cache.  It may be any valid directory name (ie. cache/queries).  In this directory, a few Berkeley DB files will be created, one called query_store.db and one for each query being cached.<br /></li></ul><h2>I18n Options</h2>These determine how Sitellite's internationalization features function.<br /><ul><li><strong>directory</strong> - Directory where global language files live.</li><li><strong>negotiate</strong> - Method of negotiating which language to use for each visitor.  See saf.I18n::negotiate() at <a href="http://www.sitellite.org/docs">http://www.sitellite.org/docs</a> for more info on this.</li><li><strong>serialize</strong> - The method to use to serialize language strings.</li></ul><h2>Messaging Options</h2>These settings can be used to provide global internal messaging capabilities to Sitellite, and to integrate them with external messaging services (ie. email, instant messaging, text messaging, etc.).  In addition to the internal messaging system in Sitellite, you can also utilize these in your custom applications.  For more info, see cms.Workspace.Message.<br /><ul><li><strong>return_address</strong> - This is the email address to use in the 'From' field of outgoing emails and text messages.  This is also the address for message recipients to reply to when sending responsed to system or forwarded messages.<br /></li><li><strong>email_server</strong> - The email server to check for incoming email.  This must be a POP3 mail server.  Ordinarily, simply setting up a dedicated email account for Sitellite on your existing mail server is sufficient to enable this functionality.<br /></li><li><strong>email_port</strong> - The port of the POP3 mail server.  The default is usually correct.<br /></li><li><strong>email_username</strong> - The username to access the email account designated to Sitellite.<br /></li><li><strong>email_password</strong> - The password to access the email account designated to Sitellite.<br /></li><li><strong>jabber</strong> - Specifies whether to enable Jabber message forwarding and receiving. Set this to "on" to enable, and "off" to disable.<br /></li><li><strong>jabber_server</strong> - The jabber server to check for incoming instant messages.  This must be a Jabber server.<br /></li><li><strong>jabber_port</strong> - The port of the Jabber server.  The default is usually correct.<br /></li><li><strong>jabber_username</strong> - The username to access the Jabber account designated to Sitellite.<br /></li><li><strong>jabber_password</strong> - The password to access the Jabber account designated to Sitellite.<br /></li></ul><br />

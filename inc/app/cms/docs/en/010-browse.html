<h1>User Interface: Browse</h1>

The Control Panel content collection browser has a number of features that make it a very powerful tool for content management, and even for basic reporting capabilities.� The following screenshot highlights these elements.<br />

<br />



The Collection Search, or "Search Parameters", allows you to perform compound searches on any collection with just a few short clicks.� For example, you could select all of the News Stories in the Sports category in Draft status awaiting approval, or all of the Web Pages that are Approved and in the Products section and have the keyword "Sitellite" found in them, and so on.<br />



<br />



The Bookmark Searches button allows you to save a collection search as an internal bookmark, so that it is accessible with a single click from the Sitellite Control Panel home screen.<br />



<br />



The Collection Paging breaks up large collections into separate screens, so that you have an easier time navigating through them.<br />



<br />



The Sortable Headers allow you to click on any header to sort the document list by that column.� If you click the same header again, it toggles the sorting order between ascending and descending.<br />



<br />



The Browsable Results are the documents themselves, which you can edit, delete, and sometimes view the change history of (if the collection selected has versioning enabled for it).� Some of these collections may be available via the Web View, such as the Web Pages and Sidebars, however this view can be a handy additional method of accessing them, and can also access collections that aren't available in the Web View.<br />

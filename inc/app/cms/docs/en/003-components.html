<h1>Programming-level components</h1>

In addition to the extensive and polished user-interface, Sitellite
features the most advanced and effective development frameworks and
APIs available to PHP programmers.&nbsp; However, advanced systems
often come with a steep learning curve, and Sitellite is no exception
to that.&nbsp; We do, however, take steps to try to ensure that your
Sitellite programming experience is both enjoyable and productive,
fast.&nbsp; For starters, there's the whole <a href="http://www.sitellite.org/">sitellite.org community</a> web site, where you'll find lots of good information, including manuals, articles/tutorials, forums, discussion lists, etc.<br />
<br />
However, the topic at hand is Sitellite's components -- so on to
it!&nbsp; Sitellite's application structure can be broken down into the
following pieces:<br />
<br />
<h2>Sitellite Application Framework (SAF)</h2>
SAF is a collection of over 100 high-quality PHP classes that can be
used to help you express your coding ideas faster.&nbsp; SAF features
packages ranging from database access, form handling and validation,
XML processing, and mail handling, to GUI classes, template processing,
and session handling.&nbsp; SAF is also PEAR-compatible, and actually
comes with a dozen or so PEAR classes pre-installed.<br />
<br />
<h2>Sitellite Content Server (SCS)</h2>
SCS is what is called a "Controller", as defined by the
Model-View-Controller (MVC) application design pattern.&nbsp; What this
means is that SCS controls the way visitor or user requests are mapped
to your data, application logic, and output templates.&nbsp; SCS is
both the glue that binds these together, and the parent who keeps them
out of each others' rooms.&nbsp; SCS also features some convenience
functions such as request caching, automatic database access, and
search engine friendly URL rewriting.<br />
<br />
SCS actually uses the SAF Loader package for much of its functionality,
which is where its real power comes in.&nbsp; Loader defines an
application structure for writing add-ons that are flexible, robust,
highly reusable, and completely independent from the rest of
Sitellite's code -- no mingling!&nbsp; This structure is so robust, in
fact, that the Sitellite Content Manager itself is merely a collection
of pre-installed add-ons (called "apps" in Sitellite-speak).<br />
<br />
SCS's app model standardizes the way you write screen-based UIs (called
"actions"), forms, libraries, templates, translations, configurations,
installations, and multi-lingual documentation for each app.&nbsp; No
other PHP-based framework considers this many aspects of an
application's design and lifecycle.<br />
<h2>Sitellite Content Manager (SCM)</h2>
SCM is the Sitellite user interface, which is discussed elsewhere
already.&nbsp; SCM also provides extended APIs specific to content
management, such as the Rex revision control system, workflow and
messaging capabilities, and more.<br />
<br />
<h2>Sitellite Task Scheduler</h2>
The Scheduler lives in the inc/app/scheduler folder, and provides
automation capabilities to rest of Sitellite.&nbsp; This includes
automatic publishing and archival of content, automated indexing of the
web site for searching, and more.<br />
<br />
<h2>SiteSearch</h2>
SiteSearch is actually a separately-distributed add-on, which is based
on the Apache Lucene project.&nbsp; However, since searching is often
an integral part of a web site infrastructure, it has been included
here for the sake of completeness.&nbsp; SiteSearch is a custom
integrated web site search solution that maps directly onto Sitellite's
versioning system and collections API, as well as Sitellite's user
access control and privileges, and can be installed into an existing
Sitellite web site in minutes.&nbsp; SiteSearch features built-in
search statistics as well, making it the ultimate web site search
solution, available only for the Sitellite platform.<br />
<br />
Please note thate Apache Lucene is a Java project, however, due to some
cleverness on our part (small self-pat-on-back), it integrates with the
PHP-based Sitellite without requiring ANY special PHP extensions or
recompiling (ie. installing the experimental Java extension).&nbsp;
This is a huge leg up over other PHP searching solutions as well.<br />

<h1>Overview of components</h1>

Sitellite 4.0 features two different editing modes for managing your web site content: Web View, and the Control Panel.<br />
<h2>Web View</h2>

The Web View, which is the default view (adjustable in your
preferences), is an inline editing mode, where web site editors will
see the Sitellite toolbar in a separate frame above their web site, and
wherever content is editable by the particular editor (based on their
permissions), the editor will see editing icons.&nbsp; Hovering over an
icon reveals what the icon does.&nbsp; For most web sites, the Web View
is the preferred method of managing web site content, since it puts
editors in a stronger relation to the environment they are targeting
content towards.&nbsp; This is a significant advantage over many other
CMSes that Sitellite offers.<br />
<h2>Control Panel</h2>

The Control Panel provides access to a listings-style view of web site
content, which can be more appropriate in some cases than inline
editing (ie. product lists, file management, etc.).&nbsp; In addition
to this, the Control Panel also provides a whole host of other
functions that show the real power of Sitellite.&nbsp; These include an
internal messaging UI, which is used by Sitellite's workflow engine to
notify people of workflow events, a user manager, which includes
managing roles, teams, and access privileges, and a list of installed
add-ons, which extend the functionality and capabilities of the core
CMS system.&nbsp; Several of these add-ons come pre-installed, and
several additional ones also come pre-installed in the Commercial
Edition only.<br />
<br />
The Control Panel's content browser also features one important piece
of functionality thus-far unique to Sitellite in the CMS world:
easy-to-use, multi-faceted search capabilities.&nbsp; If you want to
see all of the pending news stories that are in the "Sports" category,
you are only two clicks away.&nbsp; No other CMS achieves the same
level of data accessibility.<br />

1. Create database tables:

$ cd /PATH/TO/SITELLITE
$ mysql -p -u USER DBNAME < inc/app/siteconnector/install/install-mysql.sql
(enter password when prompted)

2. Define resource by either a) adding the following line to
inc/conf/auth/resources/index.php:

app_siteconnector = Off

Or b) adding the resource "app_siteconnector" via the admin tools in the
Sitellite Control Panel.

3. Define a siteconnector role by either a) copying the file
inc/app/siteconnector/install/siteconnector.php to inc/conf/auth/roles/
or b) creating a "siteconnector" role via the admin tools in the Sitellite
Control Panel with the following settings:

Name: siteconnector
Is admin?: Yes
Disabled: No
Allowed Resources: App Siteconnector (Read and Write)

You may set the allowed access levels and statuses to whatever you
want.  The default in the example file are All and All (Read and Write).

4. Before a 3rd party can connect to your SiteConnector Web Services,
you will need to create a user for them with the role "siteconnector" via
the Sitellite Control Panel.

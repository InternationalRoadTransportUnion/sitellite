Building The SAF Docs

To build the Sitellite Application Framework documentation, copy and paste
the following commands into the command line:

cd /PATH/TO/SITELLITE
cd saf
mkdir docs
./lib/PEAR/PhpDocumentor/phpdoc -dn SAF -dc SAF -ti "Sitellite Application Framework" \
	-d lib -t docs -i "*PEAR*,*Ext*" -o "HTML:Smarty:SitelliteDotOrg"

The last command will take up to 5 minutes to complete and will generate lots
of output.  In most cases, you should be able to ignore this output.  You will
know the command has finished when you see the following lines:

"Parsing time: 55 seconds

Conversion time: 244 seconds

Total Documentation Time: 299 seconds
done"

The documentation will now be available in the saf/docs folder of your
Sitellite installation.
